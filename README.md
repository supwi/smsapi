Anyone can fall for a scam. And SMS spoofing is yet another cybersecurity problem that companies and individuals must learn about to avoid becoming the next victim.

If you miss the warning signs of an SMS spoof, the implications go far beyond an inconvenience. You could find yourself dealing with identity theft, ransomware, or a huge financial loss. Or you may even be the employee responsible for opening the door for a widespread attack on your company (and its customers).

Without you even knowing, you could just end up being an unwitting participant in a botnet that scammers use to conduct other nefarious activities that youâ€™ll probably never know about, but that cause pain and suffering to others.

So itâ€™s to your benefit, as well as societyâ€™s, that we all take a moment to get a clear understanding of what SMS spoofing is, and how to prevent it.

What is SMS spoofing?
Spoofing is bigger than just SMS. It can also happen over email and even through fake online ads. This broader idea of spoofing refers to situations where a cyberscammer masquerades as a trusted entity to trick end users into doing something that benefits the hacker â€“ like clicking a link, downloading a file, or opening an attachment.

SMS spoofing refers to the specific scenarios possible on your smartphone through texting and is a type of SMS smishing. An SMS spoof can be an SMS message sent by a fraudster using an unrecognizable number, or even a recognizable one. As with other forms of spoofing, the spoof SMS will usually include some kind of link they want you to click on.  

And if you take the bait, you may end up giving them access to valuable personal information, or downloading malware onto your device that will cause trouble later.
